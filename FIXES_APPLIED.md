## Date: October 28, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Dashboard Admin (dashboard_admin.php)

**Problems Identified:**

- Logout link in sidebar was missing an icon
- Dashboard link was pointing to "#" instead of the actual page

**Fixes Applied:**

- ✅ Added Font Awesome logout icon (`fas fa-sign-out-alt`) to the logout link
- ✅ Changed dashboard link from `href="#"` to `href="dashboard_admin.php"` for proper navigation
- ✅ Sidebar navigation is now fully functional with proper icons

---

### 2. Manage Users Page (manage_user.php)

**Problems Identified:**

- Edit and Delete buttons linked to non-existent files (`edit_user.php` and `delete_user.php`)
- Sidebar link pointed to `manage_users.php` (wrong filename - should be `manage_user.php`)
- Missing admin session authentication check
- No mobile responsiveness
- Delete functionality was not implemented
- Edit functionality was not properly configured

**Fixes Applied:**

- ✅ Added admin authentication check at the top of the file
- ✅ Fixed sidebar link from `manage_users.php` to `manage_user.php`

- ✅ Added success/error message handling after delete operations
- ✅ Delete operation now also removes associated bookings to maintain data integrity

### 3. Admin Edit Page (admin_edit.php)

**Problems Identified:**

- Only supported editing bookings
- Could not edit user information
- Used mysqli instead of PDO (inconsistent with rest of application)

**Fixes Applied:**

- ✅ Converted from mysqli to PDO for consistency
- ✅ Added dual functionality: can now edit both users and bookings
- ✅ Added `type` parameter to distinguish between user and booking edits
- ✅ Implemented user editing with:
  - Username validation (check for duplicates)
  - Email validation (check for duplicates)
  - Password change option (only updates if new password provided)
  - Role restriction (only allows editing 'client' users)
- ✅ Enhanced UI with Bootstrap cards and Font Awesome icons
- ✅ Added proper error handling and validation
- ✅ Improved user feedback with success/error messages
- ✅ Added back navigation buttons
